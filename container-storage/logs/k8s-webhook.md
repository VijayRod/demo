## webhook.disable

- https://discuss.elastic.co/t/can-i-disable-the-webhook/226113: the easiest way to disable the webhook is to remove its configuration from Kubernetes: kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration. If you want to re-enable it later, just reapply ECK yaml manifests.

## webhook.multiple

- tbd https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/567353/azure-aks-policies-prohibit-deployment-of-custom-g: one can definitely have more than one validating webhooks deployed in the same cluster, but for a request to be allowed, all validating webhooks would need to reply with either "allow" or "I don't know". However, In our case, since one webhook would always reject the request, the whole request would always get rejected.
