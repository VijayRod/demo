  - The basic scheduling unit in NT is a thread.
  - Processes consist of a virtual address spacethat includes executable instructions, a set of resources such as file handles,and one or more threads that execute within its address space.
  - Typicalapplications consist of only one process, so program and processare often used synonymously
  - single-threaded,which means they run as one process with one thread. However, multithreadedprograms
  - scheduler examines the priorities of all thethreads ready to run at a given instant
  - NT assigns each thread a priority number from 1 to 31, where higher numberssignal higher priorities. (NT uses priority 0 for the system idle thread, whichexecutes when no other thread is able to.) NT reserves priorities 16 through 31(realtime priorities)
  - priority classes: realtime,high, normal, and idle.

  - process is an instance of an application or system program that runs on a system
  - Affinity is the tendency for a thread to run on a particular processor or set of system processors
  - soft affinity by default, running a thread on the same processor it ran on previously. NT also supports hard affinity to let you specify which processors a process or thread uses
  - processor's cache memory stores the most commonly used instructions

```

- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes: 0.1 is equivalent to the expression 100m, which can be read as "one hundred millicpu"
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#cpu-units: suffix m to mean milli. CPU is always requested as an absolute quantity, never as a relative quantity; 0.1 is the same amount of CPU on a single-core, dual-core, or 48-core machine.

## cpu.storage.cache

- https://robots.net/tech/where-does-cpu-store-its-computations/: each level having a different size and proximity to the CPU. The first level cache, known as L1 cache, is the fastest and smallest cache, located directly on the CPU chip. It is divided into separate instruction cache (L1i cache) and data cache (L1d cache), allowing for parallel access to instructions and data.
  - If the data or instructions are not found in the L1 cache, the CPU checks the next level of cache, called the L2 cache. The L2 cache is larger but slightly slower than the L1 cache. Depending on the system, there may be additional levels of cache, such as L3 cache, which further increase the capacity but introduce additional latency.
  - The cache management algorithms determine how data is stored and replaced in the cache. Popular caching strategies include least recently used (LRU) and least frequently used (LFU)

## cpu.storage.register

- https://robots.net/tech/where-does-cpu-store-its-computations/: Registers are incredibly fast compared to other forms of memory. They can perform operations within a single clock cycle, making them essential for efficient execution of instructions. When the CPU receives an instruction, it fetches the necessary data from memory and stores it in registers, ready for processing.
  - One important type is the program counter (PC) register, which keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be fetched from memory.
  - Another critical type of register is the accumulator, which stores intermediate results during mathematical and logical operations.
