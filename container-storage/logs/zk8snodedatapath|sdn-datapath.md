- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1084416/same-region-rounting-to-storage-account-from-subne:  When you are using a NAT Gateway subnet, for the traffic to go over the internet, the traffic needs to access the NAT gateway so that it can get a Public IP address to traverse the internet. If not, it cannot have a Public IP address. Therefore, yes, it will traverse the NAT gateway and will be charged.
